# 🧑‍💻 What is an AI Application Developer?

An **AI Application Developer** is a software engineer who **builds user-facing applications powered by AI models and services**.

> Their main focus is turning AI models into real-world tools — like chatbots, assistants, search engines, or productivity apps — by integrating them into web, mobile, or desktop applications.

---

## 🎯 What Does an AI App Developer Do?

### Core Responsibilities:

- Integrate **pretrained AI models or APIs** (e.g. GPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Build **front-end and back-end applications** that interact with AI
- Design **AI-powered workflows**, features, and UX
- Implement **LLM tooling** (e.g. LangChain, RAG pipelines, agents)
- Handle **input/output formatting**, context windows, and tokens
- Optimize latency, cost, and user interaction
- Ensure **security**, **rate limiting**, and **prompt safety**
