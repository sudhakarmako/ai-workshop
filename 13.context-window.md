# 🧠 Context Window in AI

The **Context Window** refers to the maximum number of **tokens** a language model can "see" and use at one time to generate a response.

> It's like the AI’s short-term memory — the limit of how much input (and past conversation) it can consider in a single interaction.

---

## 📏 What Is It, Exactly?

- AI models **don’t remember everything forever**.
- They rely on the **context window** to process and reason over input.
- If the total tokens (prompt + chat history + output) exceeds this window, older tokens get **truncated** or ignored.

### Formula:

context_window = input_tokens + output_tokens

---

## 🧮 Tokens vs Words

- 1 token ≈ 0.75 words (English)
- `"The quick brown fox"` → ~5 tokens
- Context is counted in **tokens**, not characters or words

## 📊 Context Window Sizes (2025)

| Model          | Context Limit (tokens)     | Approx. Words  |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| GPT-3.5        | 4,096                      | ~3,000 words   |
| GPT-4 Turbo    | 128,000                    | ~96,000 words  |
| Claude 3.5     | ~200,000                   | ~150,000 words |
| Gemini 1.5 Pro | 1,000,000                  | ~750,000 words |
| Mistral        | Varies (typically 32k–65k) | ~25,000–50,000 |
| LLaMA 3        | 8k – 65k                   | ~6k–50k words  |

## 📌 Why Context Window Matters

### ✅ What It Affects:

- **Memory**: How much prior conversation or text the model can reference
- **Comprehension**: Longer documents = better summarization or Q&A
- **Reasoning**: Multi-step or long-chain reasoning depends on full context
- **RAG systems**: Supports more retrieved documents for grounding

### ❌ Limitations:

- If you exceed the context limit:
  - Input may get **truncated**
  - Model may lose track of important earlier points
  - Output may be less coherent or relevant

## 📚 Example Scenarios

### 🔹 Short Context Model (4K tokens)

- Good for: Simple chatbots, tweet generation, basic summarization
- Limited in: Document analysis, memory continuity

### 🔹 Long Context Model (100K+ tokens)

- Good for: Legal contract analysis, multi-document Q&A, agent planning
- Can load entire books or session history

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Be concise: Avoid token overuse in prompts
- Chunk large documents before sending
- Use retrieval (RAG) to dynamically provide relevant slices
- For chatbots: store and re-insert essential history manually

## 🔍 Tools for Estimating Context Usage

| Tool                                                      | Use                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) | Estimate token count manually           |
| `tiktoken` (Python)                                       | Token counting programmatically         |
| Claude token previewer                                    | Anthropic-specific analysis             |
| LangChain or LlamaIndex                                   | For chunking and context window control |

## 🔄 Context Window ≠ Long-Term Memory

> The **context window** is temporary memory — it gets reset every new prompt.

To store information **beyond context**, you need:

- Long-term memory integration (databases, embeddings)
- Tools like LangGraph, vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Term           | Meaning                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Context Window | Max number of tokens the model can handle at once |
| Input Tokens   | All prompts, chat history, documents              |
| Output Tokens  | The model’s generated response                    |
| Truncation     | Oldest tokens get dropped when limit is exceeded  |
| Bigger window  | Better reasoning, memory, document handling       |
