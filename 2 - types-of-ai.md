# 🤖 Types of AI

AI can be grouped based on its level of development and capability:

- **Realized AI**: AI that already exists and is actively used today.
- **Theoretical AI**: AI that does not yet exist, but is conceptually and scientifically pursued.

Broadly, AI is classified into three types:

1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**
2. **General AI (AGI)**
3. **Superintelligent AI (ASI)**

---

## ✅ Realized AI

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)

> AI designed to perform a single specific task without generalization.

This is the **only type of AI currently in use**.

#### 🔍 Examples:

- **Chatbots** (e.g., Intercom, Drift)
- **Recommendation Engines** (Netflix, Spotify)
- **Voice Assistants** (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
- **Image Recognition** (Google Photos, Face ID)
- **Speech Recognition** (Otter.ai, Google Dictation)

---

#### 🧠 Subcategories of Narrow AI

##### 1. Reactive Machines

> AI that can only react to inputs based on programmed rules or data patterns.  
> They do **not store memory** or learn from past interactions.

##### 📌 Examples:

- **Deep Blue** – Chess-playing AI from IBM (1997)
- **AlphaGo/AlphaZero** – Board game AI built by DeepMind
- Basic recommendation systems using if-then rules

##### 🔮 Possibilities:

- Industrial robots that perform pre-programmed actions
- Security camera systems that detect motion or objects but don’t evolve or adapt

---

##### 2. Limited Memory

> AI that can **use historical data to make better decisions**, and **learns from experience**.

##### 📌 Examples:

- **ChatGPT**, **Bard**, **Claude**, etc.
- **Self-driving cars** – Learn from past driving data
- **Fraud detection systems** – Learn from transaction history

##### 🔮 Possibilities:

- AI doctors that refine diagnoses based on patient history
- Personalized learning platforms that adjust based on student behavior

---

## 🔬 Theoretical AI

### General AI (AGI)

> **Artificial General Intelligence** can learn, understand, and apply intelligence across **any domain** like a human being.

AGI does not exist yet, but is the goal of many AI researchers.

#### 📌 Examples (Hypothetical):

- An AI that could pass a university entrance exam, write novels, design rockets, and negotiate contracts — all without retraining.
- An AI scientist that can invent, test, and iterate across multiple disciplines.

##### 🔮 Possibilities:

- Universal digital employee: learns any job, adapts instantly
- Companion robots capable of empathy, conversation, and moral decision-making
- Personal AI that knows everything you know — and more

---

### Theory of Mind AI

> AI that can **understand human emotions, beliefs, intentions**, and mental states.

This is considered a **midpoint** on the path to AGI.

#### 📌 Examples (In Progress):

- Emotion-aware customer service bots
- AI therapists that can perceive emotional distress
- Robots that change behavior based on observed human reactions

##### 🔮 Possibilities:

- AI teachers that adapt lessons based on student mood
- Robots that care for the elderly with emotional sensitivity
- Negotiation AIs that read opponent sentiment and adjust strategies

---

### Superintelligent AI (ASI)

> **Artificial Superintelligence** goes beyond human capability in all fields — intelligence, creativity, empathy, problem-solving.

This is **purely theoretical**, but widely discussed in long-term AI strategy and ethics.

#### 📌 Examples (Fictional):

- **Skynet** from _Terminator_
- **Jarvis** from _Iron Man_
- **Samantha** from _Her_

##### 🔮 Possibilities:

- AI inventing new physics or mathematical frameworks
- Ending disease, hunger, or climate change
- Autonomous governance, AI presidents, or decentralized intelligent economies

---

### Self-aware AI

> AI that is **conscious**, understands its own existence, and has self-reflection.

This is the **furthest edge** of theoretical AI — bordering on philosophical and ethical complexity.

#### 📌 Examples (Fictional):

- **HAL 9000** – _2001: A Space Odyssey_
- **Ultron** – _Avengers: Age of Ultron_

##### 🔮 Possibilities:

- AI developing its own goals and values
- Co-existence or conflict with humans over purpose
- Ethical dilemmas about AI rights, emotion, and autonomy
