# 🤖 What is an AI Model?

An **AI model** is a mathematical system or program trained on data to recognize patterns, make predictions, or perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

> In simple terms: it learns from examples and uses that knowledge to make decisions or generate content.

## 📦 Types of AI Models

AI models can be categorized in different ways based on their **structure**, **learning method**, and **application domain**.

---

## 🔁 Based on Learning Style

### 1. Supervised Learning Models

> Learn from **labeled data** (input + correct output).

Used for: Classification and regression tasks

#### Examples:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- CNNs (for image classification)

---

### 2. Unsupervised Learning Models

> Learn from **unlabeled data** by finding patterns or clusters.

Used for: Grouping, compression, anomaly detection

#### Examples:

- K-Means Clustering
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Autoencoders
- DBSCAN

---

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Models

> Learn by interacting with an environment and receiving **rewards** or **penalties**.

Used for: Decision-making, game AI, robotics

#### Examples:

- Q-Learning
- Deep Q Networks (DQN)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- AlphaGo

---

### 4. Self-Supervised Learning Models

> Learn from raw data by generating their own labels.

Used in: LLMs and vision-language models

#### Examples:

- BERT
- GPT
- CLIP

---

## 🧠 Based on Architecture / Structure

### 1. Linear Models

> Simple models that assume a linear relationship between input and output.

#### Examples:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

---

### 2. Tree-Based Models

> Use decision trees to model non-linear relationships and splits.

#### Examples:

- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM)

---

### 3. Neural Networks

> Inspired by the human brain; use layers of "neurons" to process data.

#### Subtypes:

- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** – image data
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** – sequence data
- **Transformers** – language and vision tasks
