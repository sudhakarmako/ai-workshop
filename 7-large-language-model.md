# 🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs)

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are a type of AI model designed to understand and generate human language. They are the backbone of modern tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot.

## 📌 What is an LLM?

> An LLM is a deep learning model trained on vast amounts of text data to predict and generate natural language.

- It works by predicting the **next word or token** in a sentence.
- Built on **transformer architecture**.
- Trained on **self-supervised learning** using massive internet-scale datasets.

---

## 🏗️ How LLMs Are Built

### 1. Data Collection

- Web pages, books, code, forums, Wikipedia, and more.
- Often measured in **terabytes** or **tokens** (1 token ≈ 0.75 words).

### 2. Tokenization

- Raw text is split into smaller units (tokens).
- Converted into numerical vectors for processing.

### 3. Pretraining

- The model learns to predict the next token based on the context.
- Self-supervised (no labeled data needed).
- Trained using GPUs/TPUs across **hundreds of billions of parameters**.

### 4. Fine-tuning

- Adapt the base model to specific tasks or domains (e.g., legal, medical, coding).
- Can involve:
  - Supervised fine-tuning
  - Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

### 5. Deployment

- Hosted via APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Integrated into apps like chatbots, IDEs, browsers, productivity tools

## 💡 Key Concepts & Topics

### 1. Transformer Architecture

- The backbone of all LLMs
- Uses **self-attention** to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence

### 2. Self-Supervised Learning

- No need for manual labeling
- Predicts missing or next tokens from raw text

### 3. Pretraining vs Fine-Tuning

- **Pretraining**: Learns general language structure
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapts model for specific use-cases

### 4. Prompt Engineering

- Crafting input prompts to guide the model’s behavior
- Styles:
  - Zero-shot
  - Few-shot
  - Chain-of-thought

### 5. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

- Trains models to be more helpful, harmless, and honest
- Uses human preferences to improve outputs

### 6. Context Window

- The amount of text the model can “see” at once
- GPT-4: up to 128k tokens
- Gemini 1.5: up to 1M tokens
- Claude 3.5: long context + memory

### 7. Hallucination

- When LLMs produce confident but **factually incorrect** information
- Ongoing research area for alignment and safety

### 8. Embeddings

- Vector representations of words, sentences, or documents
- Used for similarity search, clustering, and classification
