# what is AI?

### What is intelligence?

- Ablity to learn, reason and acquire knoweldge and skils and use them to solve problems

### Intelligence evolution?

- Human exploited this evolutionary advantage the most and broke nature
- In most species intelligence is energy, species needs energy to survive
- diverse forms of intelligence
- flatworms 500 millionyear ago, simple intelligence
- species diversify and become more complex
- life conqured new enviroments and new senses and fierce competition for resources and survival
- In Nature all that matters is survival
- narrow intelligence is good enough for survival, for narrow task and problems and environments
- Birds, octopus, and mamalas evolved to be more intelligent, complex neural strutures to survive in their environments
- Homo erectus 2 million years ago - evolved from narrow intelligence to general intelligence eg screw driver to tool box
- start to think about diverse problems, learned how to make fire, make tools, and use tools to solve problems
- home spaiens 200,000 years ago - evolved from general intelligence to general intelligence with language
- Communication, complex thought, and abstract thinking
- Improved lives,
- Started asking question about how thinkgs woork and why things are work the they way it does,
- more question eqaual more knowledge
- knowledge over knowledge over time, share knowledge, and pass it on to future generations

### Progress

- Agricltural revolution 10,000 years ago
- Agriculture, writings, medicine, astronomy, math and philosophy took off
- Industrial revolution 1800s
  -- Science took off and we started to understand how things work
- Information revolution 1900s

> today we live in world make to suit our needs, created by us for us.

It was hard to reach here, intelligence ladder, we humans became powerful animals in the world in a heartbeat (earth is 4.5 billion years old)

### Turnover

- We are building machines, that very thing that gave us the power to conqure
  the planet.

> # Artificial Intelligence or AI

- is a software the performs mental tasks with a computer,

### Few examples of AI

- 1960 chrisopher strachford - first AI program
  -- Narrow and simple tasks like flatworms
- AI Research paused many time, as we were reching the limits of machines capablity.
- Limitation in computation and information.
- 1950 - 2000 - Computer was slowly getting faster and cheaper,
- 1972 - AI can navigate a maze
- 1989 - AI can read handwritten text
  -- But they are limiting and fancy tool good at one thing
- 1997 - AI beats chess, build machine good to be at one like bees or insects
  Computer improved - AI became more powerful and can do more and more tasks
  2004 - Drive robot in mars
  2011 - Recommending youtube videos

## How AI learns?

Before human broke down problem into small parts and AI was able to solve them.
Now AI is teaching itself to solve problems.

## Rise of self-learning AI

> In a nutshell, the sheer power of super computers and with atmost endless large amounts of data. was the key to the rise of self-learning AI.

### Machine learning

"An Umbrealla term for a set of techniques that allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed."

Scary things is "We don't exactly know how they do it, and what happens inside the machine. It just works."

> "A Capable black box"

now it Learn quickly without any help from humans.

Narrow intelligence but huge step-up.

2014 - Facebook can recognize your face in a photo with 97% accuracy.
2016 - Beats human in Go
2018 - Self learning AI, Learned chess from scratch and beat world champion.
"AlphaFold" - Predict protein structure from DNA sequence.

### LLM - Large Language Model

ChatGPT - made a huge step-up in AI.
Trained on 175 billion parameters (basically the entire internet)

- It can summarise, translate and help in simple tasks.
- It can write code, essays, and even poetry.

> Already AI is changing industries like law, finance, healthcare, banking, and even art.

## Narrow AI vs General AI

- Narrow AI is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to perform a specific task.
- General AI is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to perform any task that a human can do.

## AGI - Artificial General Intelligence

- AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to perform any task that a human can do.
- WE don't know how to build it, but we know it is possible.
- We are not there yet, but we are getting closer.
- We don't know how it will work,
- What is will be possible to do with it?
- Can become as smart as human?

- Today: AI can solve problems 10x than human could
- AGI may be slowe, may be faster, we don't know.
- AGI is a software, which we can duplicate endlessly as long as we have storage, power and data.

Imagine - we have 8million scientists in the world, Imagine 1 million AGI Scientists, working 24/7, 365 days a year without and distraction and focused on only 1 think, we cannot comprehend the power of it and what we can do.

Researches are beliving we will have AGI by this century.

> Who ever controls the data, controls the world (economy, politics, and everything).

AGI can solve fundamental problems of the world, like poverty, hunger, and disease.

- Dark energy, dark matter, and other fundamental problems of the world.
- Aging, cancer, can it be cured?
- GOD?

It can be used in destructive way, like nuclear weapons, or to destroy the world.
Drone, Virus, war, kill people, and destroy the world?

- Humans cause climate change, AGI can solve it, or see humans as a problem and destroy them?
  AGI is equal to electricity, it can be used for good or bad.

### What if AGI does not stop?

- AGI can creat own AI that can do anything maytime, a super intelliget entity
- we may seem like ant or squirel compared to AGI - Super intelligent entity
